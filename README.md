### Hi there 👋


My name is João Pedro Jardim Rodrigues, and I'm a graduate student of software development with background in psychology. I have recently shifted my focus to software development and Im excited to share that with the community.

Start studying in [@minderacodeacademy](https://minderacodeacademy.com/) in 2023.  During this time, i have learned multiple tools from BackEnd and FrontEnd perspectives.

Currently working on [@Atena-AI](https://www.atena-ai.pt/) and [@Hashdash](https://hashdash.com/)
