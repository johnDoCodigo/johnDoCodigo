### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is JoÃ£o Pedro Jardim Rodrigues, and I'm a graduate student of software development with background in psychology. I have recently shifted my focus to software development and Im excited to share that with the community.

This year i have been studying in [@minderacodeacademy](https://minderacodeacademy.com/).  During this time, i have learned multiple tools from BackEnd and FrontEnd perspectives.
